*(SETI Institute Code Challenge https://github.com/setiquest/ml4seti)*
A CNN model is trained on a series of simulated signals that imitate the observations of the SETI institute.
By converting radio signal data into a spectrogram (2D visual representation), the problem can be transformed into something close to an image classification problem.
