**- Machine Learning for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence**

*(SETI Institute Code Challenge https://github.com/setiquest/ml4seti)*
A CNN model is trained on a series of simulated signals that imitate the observations of the SETI institute.
By converting radio signal data into a spectrogram (2D visual representation), the problem can be transformed into something close to an image classification problem.



**- Particle identification**

A neural network classifier is trained to determine the type of particle. The electron, proton, muon, kaon, pion, and ghost are the six types of particles (another type of particle or detector noise).
